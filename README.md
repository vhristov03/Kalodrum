# Description
This is a game called Pesho for Nature and developed for the 2021 HackTuesGG TUES hackathon (https://elsys-bg.org).

The game is about Pesho, a programmer, who is forced to go outside of his home because a forest fire has melted the electricity cables near his town. He goes on a (short) adventure to help put down the fire, working as a volunteer firefighter. 

Developed by 5 Spreltaci Studious (not a real studio).
